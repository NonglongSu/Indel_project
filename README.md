# Profiling of Indel Phases in Coding Regions
* EM training of MG94+GTR codon substitution model.  
* Indel phase analysis from a sliding-window method.  
* EM training of an indel-phase probabilistic model.   
* Indel phase analysis across 90 pairwise species via three alignment methods.  

## Requirements
* R 3.4.4 + 
* Mafft --version V.7.407 
* Prank --version v.170427  
 
## Workflow
* To be continued.
